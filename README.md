# AFakeArtistPlaysLocal

This is a simple way to play "A Fake Artist Goes to New York" with friends at home. It eliminates the necessity to have a GM.

## Overview

AFakeArtistPlaysLocal is a React-based web application built with Vite. The game assigns roles to players randomlyâ€”one player becomes the secret "Imitador" while the rest are "Artistas". Each player interacts with a scratch card interface to reveal their role and (if applicable) the secret word.

## How to Play

1. **Player Setup:**  
   - Enter the number of players (minimum 3) on the initial screen.
   - Click the **Comenzar** button to start the game.

2. **Gameplay:**  
   - On each turn, the current player's scratch card will display their role.
   - If the player is not the "Imitador", the secret word and its category are revealed.
   - Click the **Siguiente!** button to progress to the next player.  
   - Once all players have taken their turn, the button will show **Reiniciar** to restart the game.

This game is in spanish, feel free to translate and do whatever you want with the project.
This is good enough for me and my friends, i hate JS, React and webdev, so i probably won't be touching much of this repository for now.
